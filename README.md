# SCT_DS_03 – Decision Tree Classifier

## Task Description
Build a Decision Tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data.

## Dataset
Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Approach
- Loaded and preprocessed the dataset
- Encoded categorical variables
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained a Decision Tree classifier
- Evaluated using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, and ROC-AUC
- Analyzed feature importance

## Tools Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Results
The model demonstrates that features such as duration, campaign details, and customer history play a significant role in predicting purchase behavior.
